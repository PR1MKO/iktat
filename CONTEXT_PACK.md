# CONTEXT_PACK — minimal index for Codex

## How to run (local)
- Fast tests: `pytest -q -k "smoke or rbac"` (humans only)
- Full tests: `pytest -q`
- App (Windows): `FLASK.bat`  ·  Migrations: `MIG.bat`

## Notes for Codex
- Plan → Exec; JSON-only diffs; reasoning_effort=minimal for edits.
- **Do NOT run tests** during setup/maintenance.
- Ask for missing snippets; avoid full-file dumps.
